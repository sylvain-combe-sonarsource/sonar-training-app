# sonar-training-app

This is an example Javascript application suitable for demonstrating the analysis features of SonarQube.

## Build requirements
There is no build per se. However for analysis to succeed you'll need `node.js` installed.

### Building with Jenkins
Note the named dependencies in the `Jenkinsfile` for SonarQube, the SonarScanner, and NodeJS. Appropriate global tools must be installed. For NodeJS, use the [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nodejs/) to add the global tool.
